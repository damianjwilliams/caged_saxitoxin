Igor Pro scripts were used for AP detection and analysis of AP waveform. 

The Igor Pro scripts contain a functions to import .abf files written by Rothman JS and Silver RA.

`Figure_4_AP_characteristics.ipf` contains functions used to analyze the AP waveform, and export example traces. **,A - B, D - J, M**

`Figure_4_AP_phase_plane.ipf` was used to generate the phase plane plot.**C**

`Figure_4_AP_raster.ipf` was used to create an action potential raster plot.**K - M**

Python scripts were used to calculate current source densities from LFP recordings.

`Figure_S12_CSD_quantification.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook which contains code used to calculate current sources and sinks and generate the figure.
